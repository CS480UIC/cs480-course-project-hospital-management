Hospital Management
# Author(s)
Hello my name is Cynthia Lopez and I am currently attending the University of Illinois. I am a senior studying Computer Science. My main interests are data science, AI, and cyber security. I would like to apply all the knowledge gained at UIC and apply it to real world problems/challenges. This project will do just that!
# Database description
### Topic
I am interested in designing a database system for managing a hospital. Data Management in hospital can be used for obtaining information on the patient, arranging the doctors/nurses schedule, and accounting business.
### Description
A collection of papers are submitted to the conference, each of which has a unique paper ID, a list of authors (names, affiliations, emails) in the order of contribution significance, title, abstract, and a PDF file for its content. The conference has a list of program committee (PC) members to review the papers. To ensure review quality, each paper is assigned to 3 PC members for review. To avoid overloading, each PC member is assigned to at most 5 papers, assuming that there are enough PC members. Each review report consists of a report ID, a description of review comment, a final recommendation (accept, reject), and the date the review report is submitted. A PC member can submit at most one review report for the paper that is assigned to him/her.
For all parts of this project, your system must be web-based. Some simple GUI interfaces are required for each functionality. All functionality must be performed via the interface of your system, direct SQL statement execution via any tools (MySQL workbench) is not allowed.
Start your project early, and ask questions if you have doubts. Do not wait until the last minute.
