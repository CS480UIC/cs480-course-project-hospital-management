# Author(s)
Hello my name is Cynthia Lopez and I am currently attending the University of Illinois. I am a senior studying Computer Science. My main interests are data science, AI, and cyber security. I would like to apply all the knowledge gained at UIC and apply it to real world problems/challenges. This project will do just that!
# Database description
### Topic
I am interested in designing a database system for managing a hospital. Data Management in hospital can be used for obtaining information on the patient, arranging the doctors/nurses schedule, and accounting business.
### Description
A collection of patients, doctor/physician, and nurses information is submitted to the hospital using the UI. Each patient has a unique SSN, name, age, gender, home address, phone number, and the physician ID (this is the physician who is registered to the patient). The physican will include a unique employee ID, name, position, and department. The department will include name and department ID. The department will help with identifying the department each physician works in. The nurse will have a unique employee ID, name, and position (i.e. head nurse). The patient will have an appointment that will provide the nurse who assisted, a unique ID of the appointment, and the physician ID who helped.
